# Basketball Data Science Project
This was the final project of my Elements of Data Science class. The goal of this project was to see whether there was an association between advanced metrics (PER, EFF, etc) and positions (PG, SG, etc). In other words, do these metrics tend to favor certain positions over others?

Part One of the Project (Data Exploration Phase) can be seen here: https://viren-velacheri.github.io/project1/#Name:_Viren_Velacheri,_EID:_vv6898
Part Two of the Project (Prediction/Classifying Phase) can be see here: https://viren-velacheri.github.io/project2/#Name:_Viren_Velacheri,_EID:_vv6898
